            <p class="p1">Ibiza is one of the Balearic Islands, off Spain's Mediterranean coast. About 3,000 years ago, Phoenician traders first brought Egyptian hounds to the rocky island. Islanders used packs of these hounds as rabbit hunters. Food was scarce on rugged Ibiza. For hounds and hunter, chasing rabbits wasn't sport-it was more likely a matter of eating or going hungry. These many centuries later, Ibizans are still tenacious coursers blessed with blazing speed.</p>

            <p class="p1">Ibizan Hounds are generally healthy dogs, though there are some conditions the breed can be prone to. These include hip dysplasia, eye disease, autoimmune thyroiditis, and congenital deafness. Responsible breeders will screen their stock for conditions that can affect the breed. The website of the breed's national parent club The Ibizan Hound Club of the United Statesprovides detailed information on breed health. Regular visits to the vet for checkups and parasite control help to ensure the dog a long, healthy life.</p>

            <summary class="summary1">Grooming</summary>
            <p class="p1">Ibizan coats come in smooth and wire varieties, with a wide range in how profuse the wire coat can be. Both varieties should be groomed upright earsshould be checked weekly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which could result in an infection. The teeth should be brushed often, daily if possible, using a toothpaste formulated for dogs.</p>

            <summary class="summary1">Exercise</summary>
            <p class="p1">Beezers are very athletic and require a lot of exercise. It is not uncommon for an Ibizan to be able to jump five or six feet from a standing position, so a tall, secure fence is the order of the day for owners of this breed. The Beezer will enjoy vigorous daily play-sessions with his owner or with other dogs, or he can go for long walks a couple of times a day. The Ibizan has a very strong prey drive and should not be allowed off leash in an uncontrolled setting, as he is apt to take off on a chase after perceived prey at a moment's notice. The breed makes a wonderful companion for a regular jogger.</p>

            <summary class="summary1">Training</summary>
            <p class="p1">Versatile and trainable, Ibizans make excellent family pets. The breed is even-tempered, affectionate, and loyal. The Ibizan is bit aloof but a sweet-natured, family-oriented housemate. Alert and watchful of strangers, they are nevertheless friendly and outgoing dogs. Puppies should be cheerful, playful, and healthy. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Ibizans excel in a number of canine sports, including lure coursing, obedience, agility, rally, and tracking.</p>
